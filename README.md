# aws-workshop-twitter
Twitter bot(s) based on Lambda

## Overview 

In this builders session, you will build a serverless twitter bot.

There are 2 kind of bots you could build depending on your choice:
1. A simple retweet bot which will look for terms you are interested in and will retweet it automatically.
2. A bot which will update image sent to you based on specific keyword you define

Some of the features that you would be building today are:
- Store your twitter credentials in SSM for reuse
- Trigger event regurlarly to gather tweets
- Retweet automatically
- Store messages in a queue for processing

## Requirements

This workshop requires:

- An active AWS Account with administrative permissions.
- A Cloud9 environment is recommended, but, if you are using your own laptop, you should have AWS-CLI and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.
- Knowledge of Python will be an added advantage.
- Knowledge of AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS will be an added advantage.
- An active twitter account

### Enable your developer twitter account
[Developer twitter account - get started](https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started)
- To enable your account, you need a valid phone number (verified through a text message with verification code)
- Fill the Account details (personal use, country of operation)
- Fill the use case details (categories, description with 300 characters minimum)
- Sample:
```
1. I am using twitter API to look for tweets related to technological topics or images 
2. I plan to analyze tweets to be able to thank automatically people and also to detect trends in the images, text provided.
3. I will be tweeting content when a given content is interesting.
4. Tweets will be displayed on my timeline.
```
- Finalize your activation   
    - Read the terms of service and accept
    - New verification is sent to your email to confirm the developer account

## Create your twitter application
1. Click on create application
2. Fill the information to give a name and small description (10 words)
<img src="./images/1_twitter_create_app.png" width="50%" height="50%">
3. Put a website URL
4. Check the box for signing in Twitter
5. Put a callback url (not used) so put the same as your website URL
<img src="./images/2_twitter_create_app.png" width="50%" height="50%">
6. Put the description text, reuse the one above when you enabled your developer account.
<img src="./images/3_twitter_createapp.png" width="50%" height="50%">
7. As soon as your application is created, go to the tab named **Keys and tokens**
8. Generate the access tokens
<img src="./images/4_create_tokens.png" width="50%" height="50%">
9. These tokens will be used later to authenticate against twitter and make searches, tweets.

### Resources for AWS CLI and SAM CLI:
Interact with AWS environments and twitter through Python:
- SAM CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html
- To upgrade to last version of AWS CLI:
  - ```pip install awscli --upgrade --user```
- To upgrade to last version of SAM CLI:
  - ```pip install aws-sam-cli --user```

## Steps:

0. Define the bot you want to do (the simple is Bot 1)
1. [Manage your Twitter credentials in AWS for use in lambdas](./00-Twitter_credentials/README.md)
2. [Setting up AWS Cloud 9 Development Environment](./00-AWS_Cloud9/README.md)
3. [Bot 1](./Bot1/README.md)
4. [Bot 2](./Bot2/README.md)
